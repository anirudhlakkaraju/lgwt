# Learn Go with Tests

This repository contains code and exercises from the resource [*Learn Go with Tests*](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) I'm using this project to learn Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Go. 

The goal is to improve my skills in writing tests, following best practices, and understanding the standard library. Hopefully build something nice. Each folder corresponds to a different concept with code written in a test-first approach.

Ready, test, go!
